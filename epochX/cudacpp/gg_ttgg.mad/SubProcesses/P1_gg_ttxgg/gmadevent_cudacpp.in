+1 ! Fortran bridge mode (CppOnly=1, FortranOnly=0, BothQuiet=-1, BothDebug=-2)
32768 ! Number of events in a single C++ or CUDA iteration (nb_page_loop)
262144 1 1 ! Number of events and max and min iterations
0.000001 ! Accuracy (ignored because max iterations = min iterations)
0 ! Grid Adjustment 0=none, 2=adjust (NB if = 0, ftn26 will still be used if present)
1 ! Suppress Amplitude 1=yes (i.e. use MadEvent single-diagram enhancement)
0 ! Helicity Sum/event 0=exact
1 ! Channel number (1-N) for single-diagram enhancement multi-channel (NB used even if suppress amplitude is 0!)
